# Wheel of Names

## Overview
The **Wheel of Names** is a web-based interactive tool that randomly selects a name from a list. The selected name is removed from the wheel to prevent duplicate selections. The project features smooth spinning animations, a winner modal, a confetti effect, and a reset button to restore all names.

## Features
- 🎡 **Spinning Wheel**: The wheel spins with a smooth deceleration animation.
- 🏆 **Winner Selection**: A random winner is chosen and displayed in a modal.
- ❌ **Remove Winner**: Once a person is selected, they are removed from the wheel.
- 🎉 **Confetti Effect**: A confetti animation plays when a winner is chosen.
- 🔄 **Reset Button**: Restores the original list of names and enables spinning again.
- 🎨 **Styled with Tailwind CSS**: The UI is clean and responsive.

## How It Works
1. Click the **"Spin the Wheel"** button to start spinning.
2. The wheel will slow down and stop on a random name.
3. The winner's name is displayed in a pop-up modal.
4. Confetti appears to celebrate the selection.
5. The selected name is removed from the wheel.
6. If all names are removed, the spin button is disabled.
7. Click **"Reset Wheel"** to restore all names and start over.
